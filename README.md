📊 In 2014, managers gave their employees an average rating of 5, indicating high performance satisfaction. However, in 2017, the average manager rating dropped to 3, suggesting a significant decrease in perceived employee performance. Additionally, the attrition rate increased slightly from 3.83 in 2014 to 3.25 in 2017. This indicates that there might be a correlation between lower manager ratings and increased attrition, emphasizing the need for a closer look at performance evaluations and their impact on employee retention.
